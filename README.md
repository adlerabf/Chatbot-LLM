# Chatbot-LLM
As part of my graduate research, I developed with help of [Leon Explains AI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUjO8b6_ZuM&t=1904s) YouTube tutorial, this chatbot to function as a personal knowledge assistant. It uses HuggingFace [TheBloke/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.1-GGUF](https://huggingface.co/TheBloke/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.1-GGUF) language model to provide summaries of various file formats, including PDFs, audio files, and images.
